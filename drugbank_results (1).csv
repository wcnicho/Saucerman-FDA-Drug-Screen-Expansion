Also known as Dermagraft, this device is a cryopreserved human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute. Composed of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and a bioabsorbable scaffold, it effectively supports wound healing [L2418].

Dermagraft has only been available in the United States as an investigational device (IDE). Dermagraft for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers was approved for sale in Canada in 1997. Dermagraft was introduced in the United Kingdom in October 1997, and several other European countries, as well as New Zealand and Australia. The device is available for commercial distribution in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, and The United Kingdom [L2418].

The impact of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) on individuals and society is devastating. Failure to observe proper wound care in this condition often results in amputation. If wound closure is achieved, it is likely to delay the need for surgical intervention and provide other benefits such as improvements in productivity, mental outlook, social interactions, and time at work, in addition to decreased mortality [L2438].

Cholecystokinin, previously called _pancreozymin_, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine) and leads to the release of bile and digestive enzymes. CCK also acts as an appetite suppressant and has been studied for weight management regimens [L1637]. 

Normally, it is an endogenous hormone but is available commercially for diagnostic processes and replacement in pancreatic insufficiency [L1646, L1647, L1648]. in the octapeptide form.



Cholecystokinin is one of the first gastrointestinal hormones discovered, identified more than 90 years ago due to its ability to stimulate gallbladder contraction in 1928. Soon after, it was recognized to be identical to the factor responsible for stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion in 1943 [L1636]. This hormone has also been shown to have positive effects on enteric smooth muscle contraction and on nerve activity at multiple locations in the peripheral and central nervous system. In addition to its roles in promoting smooth muscle cell contraction/exocrine cell secretion, CCK promotes cell growth, energy production, gene expression and protein synthesis, processes that have profound for drug development [L1636].  This drug has also been investigated for possible antipsychotic properties, owing to its effect on CCK receptors in the brain [L1638].

A newer study suggests implies that an imbalance of zinc is associated with the neuronal damage associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and seizures [A32465].

 Understanding the mechanisms that control brain zinc homeostasis is, therefore, imperative to the development of preventive and treatment regimens for these and other neurological disorders [A32465].

It is composed of epidermal, dermal and hypodermal layers. The barrier function of the skin owed to its avascular epidermal layer, which is made mainly of keratinocytes. The keratinocytes form a stratified epithelium, with growing basal cells at the innermost layer and the keratinized, and mostly impermeable outer stratum corneum layer on the surface [L2452].

Foreskin keratinocytes are a form of skin cells that are cultured as a skin cell replacement for wounds, to accelerate wound closure and healing [L2434], [L2460]. 

The defining moment in skin culture was in 1975 when Rheinwald and Green successfully grew human keratinocytes on lethally irradiated murine fibroblasts. In 1981, O’Conner and his group utilized cultured autologous epithelium to coat burn defects for the first time. To construct a ""living"" alternative, a dermal substitute based on collagen I gel was created with mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts. When an epidermal layer was added, this approach became known as ""skin equivalent"", ""composite culture"" or ""organotypical culture"" [L2453].

Foreskin keratinocytes are an important ingredient in several skin substitutes [L2460], used for various indications. 
Keratinocytes are derived from neonatal foreskins and used to create a drug called _Apligraf_, a mixture of [DB10770] and keratinocytes. A gel made of bovine collagen is used as the matrix for cell growth and differentiation. Apligraf has been useful in the treatment of venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, by increasing rates of wound healing and decreasing the time required for closure of wounds [L2452].

Orcel, another skin substitute,  is similar to Apligraf since it contains both fibroblasts and keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskin, but in addition, utilizes a type I collagen sponge as its matrix. It is used for grafting onto partial-thickness wounds, where it offers a favorable matrix for host cell migration [L2452].",Allogeneic Cultured Cell Scaffold,Fibroblast growth factor 1; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor subunit alpha; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-6; Interferon gamma; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha; TGF-beta receptor type-2; Transforming growth factor beta-1; Tumor necrosis factor; Vascular endothelial growth factor A,agonist

This drug binds to the IL-1 receptor, competing with and inhibiting the activity of IL-1 alpha and beta.[L35415] Anakinra is indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients 18 years of age or older who have failed one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), as well as the treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).[L35415] Since IL-1 has an important role in inflammation and immunological responses, anakinra is also used for the off-label treatment of inflammatory diseases.[A247000]

A few studies have evaluated the use of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19; however, further research is needed to validate the use of this drug in patients with COVID-19.[A247265] Anakinra is produced using the _E. Coli_ bacterial expression system. On November 14, 2001, it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. However, studies find that Trans-resveratrol undergoes negligible oxidation in normal atmosphere at room temperature.","Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Antioxidants; Antiplatelet agents; Antirheumatic Agents; Benzene Derivatives; Benzylidene Compounds; Biological Factors; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Enzyme Inhibitors; Hematologic Agents; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Hydrocarbons, Cyclic; Phenols; Polyphenols; Protective Agents; Stilbenes; Stilbestrols; Vasodilating Agents","Transthyretin; Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase [quinone]; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Casein kinase II subunit alpha; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2-beta; Integrin alpha-5; Integrin beta-3; Serum albumin; Amyloid beta A4 protein; Alpha-synuclein; Estrogen receptor alpha; Melatonin receptor type 1A; Melatonin receptor type 1B; C-type lectin domain family 14 member A; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 3; Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 1; Carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase; Far upstream element-binding protein 2; Tyrosine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmic",inhibitor; substrate; inducer

More commonly, fish oil refers to the omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [FDA Label]. In general, dietary or pharmaceutical intake of these acids is primarily the only way to increase their levels in the human body where they are overall an essential element to dietary health as they have demonstrated abilities in minimizing or preventing hypertriglyceridemia when taken as an adjunct to a healthy diet [FDA Label].

Such fish oils are available in both non-prescription and prescription-only varieties at different concentrations. For many individuals, taking non-prescription fish oils as part of their multivitamin regimen is an effective way to supplement their diets with the healthy fatty acids. However, prescription-only fish oil products are sometimes prescribed for individuals who demonstrate severe (>= 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia [FDA Label].

Furthermore, a variety of studies regarding additional potential actions of fish oil omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are ongoing. Such experimental actions include inflammation modulation, cardioprotective effects, the attenuation of oxidative stress, and more. Regardless, the specific mechanisms of action for these effects have yet to be formally elucidated.",Agents causing hyperkalemia; Antiarrhythmic agents; Bradycardia-Causing Agents; Calcium Channel Blockers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Fish Oils; Lipids; Oils; Vasodilating Agents,Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; Free fatty acid receptor 4; Voltage gated L-type calcium channel; Sodium channel protein; Free radicals; Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B; Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta; Cytochrome P450 3A4,agonist; inhibitor; inhibits downstream inflammation cascades; regulator; substrate

It works by selectively inhibiting class I PI3K p110α [A179203], which is the catalytic subunit of PI3K, a lipid kinase that plays a role in various biological processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Alpelisib was designed to target this enzyme that appears to be mutated at a rate of nearly 30% in human cancers, leading to hyperactivation.[A179209] 

There are several isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors that are under clinical development or currently approved, such as [idelalisib] used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).[A179209] Approved by the FDA in May 2019, alpelisib is the first approved PI3K inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with [fulvestrant] for postmenopausal women and male patients. To initiate alpelisib therapy, it is required that the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in the tissue and/or liquid biopsy sample collection should be confirmed via FDA-approved diagnostic tests. Alpelisib is marketed under the trade name Piqray and is available as oral tablets. Studies evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of alpelisib in other cancers, such as ovarian cancer [A179200] and colorectal cancer [A179203], are under ongoing investigations.

Alpelisib was granted FDA approval on 24 May 2019.[L6652] In April 2022, the FDA granted the use of alpelisib in the treatment of PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) in adults and children who require systemic therapy.[L41384]","Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents; Azoles; BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors; BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates; Breast Neoplasms; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (moderate); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers (moderate); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Kinase Inhibitor; Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs; P-glycoprotein inhibitors; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, antagonists & inhibitors; Sulfur Compounds","Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C19; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; P-glycoprotein 1",inhibitor; substrate; inducer

While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.","Acetic Acid Derivatives and Related Substances; Agents causing hyperkalemia; Agents that produce hypertension; Analgesics; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal (Non-Selective); Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products; Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products, Non-Steroids; Antirheumatic Agents; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity; Enzyme Inhibitors; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Hydrocarbons, Cyclic; Indenes; Musculo-Skeletal System; Nephrotoxic agents; Non COX-2 selective NSAIDS; OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors; Other Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents; Peripheral Nervous System Agents; Photosensitizing Agents; Polycyclic Compounds; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Sensory System Agents",Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; Aldose reductase; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta; Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2; Serum albumin; Solute carrier family 22 member 6; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10,inhibitor; negative modulator; antagonist

TNF,Infliximab,DB00065,L04AB02,"Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha or TNF-α) blocker and a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody composed of human constant (75%) and murine variable (25%) regions [A31469]. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-α [A106], infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-α with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-α [A106].

Infliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron's disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [FDA Label]. 

There are currently two biosilimars of infliximab available in the US market that demonstrate a high degree of similarity to the reference product, Remicade. They are approved for all eligible indications of the reference product. Inflectra, a first biosimilar drug product, was approved in 2016. In December 2017, Ixifi, a second biosimilar that was developed by Pfizer, was granted approval by the FDA.","Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity; Agents reducing cytokine levels; Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents; Antirheumatic Agents; Biological Products; Biologics for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment; Blood Proteins; Complex Mixtures; Dermatologicals; Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Agents; Gastrointestinal Agents; Globulins; Immunoglobulins; Immunoproteins; Immunosuppressive Agents; Proteins; Serum Globulins; Tumor Necrosis Factor Blockers; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Blocking Activity",Tumor necrosis factor,inhibitor

Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.

In general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].
