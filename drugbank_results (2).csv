When used for oral or IM administration, estradiol is commonly synthesized as a pro-drug ester (such as [DB13952], [DB13953], [DB13954], [DB13955], and [DB13956]). Because it has a low oral bioavailability on its own, estradiol is commonly formulated with an ester side-chain. [DB00977] (EE) is a synthetic form of estradiol commonly used as the estrogenic component of most combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Ethinyl estradiol is different from estradiol due to its higher biovailability and increased resistance to metabolism, rendering it more suitable for oral administration.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Androgens and Estrogens; Antiandrogens and Estrogens; BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors; COMT Substrates; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptives, Oral; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Estradiol Congeners; Estradiol, agonists; Estranes; Estrenes; Estrogen Contraceptives; Estrogens; Estrogens, agonists; Fused-Ring Compounds; Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormonal Contraceptives for Systemic Use; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents; Intravaginal Contraceptives; Medications that reduce magnesium levels; Natural and Semisynthetic Estrogens, Plain; OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OCT2 Inhibitors; P-glycoprotein substrates; Polycyclic Compounds; Progestogens and Estrogens, Sequential Preparations; Sex Hormones and Modulators of the Genital System; Steroids; Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers; UGT1A1 Substrates","Estrogen receptor alpha; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Sex hormone-binding globulin; Estrogen receptor beta; Cytochrome P450 1A2; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Serum albumin; Fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Solute carrier family 22 member 2; Solute carrier family 22 member 3; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7; Solute carrier family 22 member 11; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; P-glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4; G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1; ATP synthase subunit a; Beclin-1; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15; Catechol O-methyltransferase; UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs); Cytochrome P450 19A1",agonist; binder; substrate; inhibitor; downregulator; regulator; inducer; product of

Estradiol acetate is commercially available as Femring, a vaginal ring used for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems.

Administration of synthetic and bioidentical forms of estrogen, such as estradiol cypionate, has shown to improve these menopausal symptoms.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Hormonal; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Estradiol Congeners; Estranes; Estrenes; Estrogen Contraceptives; Estrogens; Fused-Ring Compounds; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormonal Contraceptives for Systemic Use; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OCT1 inhibitors; OCT2 Inhibitors; Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors; P-glycoprotein substrates; Polycyclic Compounds; Reproductive Control Agents; Steroids; Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers; UGT1A1 Substrates","Estrogen receptor alpha; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Sex hormone-binding globulin; Estrogen receptor beta; Cytochrome P450 1A2; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Serum albumin; Fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Solute carrier family 22 member 2; Solute carrier family 22 member 1; Solute carrier family 22 member 3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7; Solute carrier family 22 member 11; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; P-glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4; Nuclear receptor coactivator 2; G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1; ATP synthase subunit a; Beclin-1; Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 2; Estrogen-related receptor gamma",agonist; substrate; inhibitor; inducer; ligand

Estradiol is the most potent form of all mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As a pro-drug of estradiol, estradiol acetate therefore has the same downstream effects within the body through binding to the Estrogen Receptor (ER) including ERα and ERβ subtypes, which are located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain.

[DB00783] is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects [A12102]. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen [T84].

Estradiol valerate is commercially available as an intramuscular injection as the product Delestrogen and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause, for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure, and for the treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate (for palliation only). Estradiol valerate is also available in combination with [DB09123] as the commercially available product Natazia used for the prevention of pregnancy and for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems. Administration of synthetic and bioidentical forms of estrogen, such as estradiol valerate, has shown to improve these menopausal symptoms.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Estradiol Congeners; Estradiol, agonists; Estranes; Estrenes; Estrogen Contraceptives; Estrogens; Fused-Ring Compounds; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormonal Contraceptives for Systemic Use; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OCT1 inhibitors; OCT2 Inhibitors; Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors; P-glycoprotein substrates; Polycyclic Compounds; Steroids; Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers; UGT1A1 Substrates","Estrogen receptor alpha; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Sex hormone-binding globulin; Estrogen receptor beta; Cytochrome P450 1A2; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Serum albumin; Fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Solute carrier family 22 member 2; Solute carrier family 22 member 1; Solute carrier family 22 member 3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7; Solute carrier family 22 member 11; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; P-glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4; Nuclear receptor coactivator 2; G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1; ATP synthase subunit a; Beclin-1; Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 2; Estrogen-related receptor gamma",agonist; substrate; inhibitor; inducer; ligand

In the United States, DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. DHEA and DHEAS are readily available in the United States, where they are marketed as over-the-counter dietary supplements. In November 2016, DHEA was approved (as Intrarosa) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause.

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]","BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates; Benzene Derivatives; Benzylidene Compounds; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strong); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Estrogen Agonist-antagonists; Estrogen Agonist/Antagonist; Estrogen Antagonists; Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones; Hormone Antagonists; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Hydrocarbons, Cyclic; Medications that reduce magnesium levels; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates; OATP1B3 substrates; P-glycoprotein substrates; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Sex Hormones and Modulators of the Genital System; Stilbenes; UGT1A1 Substrates",Estrogen receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor beta; Aldehyde oxidase; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 19A1; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Serpin B9; Trefoil factor 1; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Serum albumin; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; P-glycoprotein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-10; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-8,agonist; inhibitor; substrate; binder

The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of clove is higher than that of many fruits, vegetables, and other spices [A33133].

Clove is native of Indonesia but is now cultured in several parts of the world, including Brazil in the state of _Bahia_. This plant represents one of the richest source of phenolic compounds such as _eugenol_, _eugenol acetate_ and _gallic acid_ and has great potential for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and agricultural applications [A33133].

Interestingly, clove oil has been studied for its potential benefit in treating neuropathic pain, as well as vaginal candidiasis with promising results [A33137], [A33144].

Iron is an essential element involved in various metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and energy production in electron transport [A32514]. Resulting from inadequate supply of iron to cells due to depletion of stores, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, particularly affecting children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women [L2257]. Iron deficiency may be characterized without the development of anemia, and may result in functional impairments affecting cognitive development and immunity mechanisms, as well as infant or maternal mortality if it occurs during pregnancy [A32514]. The main therapeutic preparation of iron is [DB13257], and iron-sucrose may also be given intravenously [T28].

Iron exists in two oxidation states: the ferrous cation (Fe2+) and ferric cation (Fe3+). Non-haem iron in food is mainly in the ferric state, which is the insoluble form of iron, and must be reduced to the ferrous cation for absorption [T28].

Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]

In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T<sub>4</sub>, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T<sub>3</sub>. While T<sub>4</sub> is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T<sub>3</sub> exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]

Prior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]","Agents used to treat hypothyroidism; Amino Acids; Amino Acids, Aromatic; Amino Acids, Cyclic; Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (moderate); Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OATP1B3 inhibitors; Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors; P-glycoprotein inducers; Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.","Amines; Antioxidants; Biogenic Amines; Biogenic Monoamines; Biological Factors; Central Nervous System Agents; Central Nervous System Depressants; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Indoles; Melatonin Receptor Agonists; Melatonin, agonists; Nervous System; OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors; Protective Agents; Psycholeptics; Tryptamines","Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase; Melatonin receptor type 1A; Melatonin receptor type 1B; Nuclear receptor ROR-beta; Calmodulin; Calreticulin; Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase [quinone]; Myeloperoxidase; Estrogen receptor alpha; Eosinophil peroxidase; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase; Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Myeloperoxidase; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Cytochrome P450 19A1",agonist; inhibitor; antagonist; substrate

A newer study suggests implies that an imbalance of zinc is associated with the neuronal damage associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and seizures [A32465].

 Understanding the mechanisms that control brain zinc homeostasis is, therefore, imperative to the development of preventive and treatment regimens for these and other neurological disorders [A32465].

In addition to the above, recent review articles have already demonstrated the important role of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders, plus discussed the potential value of zinc as a marker of these diseases [L2097].  Most recently, research has shown that polymorphism of the common polymorphism in zinc transporter _SLC30A8/ZnT8_ may increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes provided novel insights into the role of zinc in diabetes [A32416].","Agents for Treatment of Hemorrhoids and Anal Fissures for Topical Use; Cardiovascular System; Copper Absorption Inhibitor; Diet, Food, and Nutrition; Elements; Food; Metal cations; Metal divalent cations; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Micronutrients; Minerals; Physiological Phenomena; Trace Elements; Transition Elements; Vasoprotectives; Zinc Compounds","B1 bradykinin receptor; Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase; Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A; Elongation factor 1-alpha 1; Alpha-enolase; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, testis-specific; Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A; Protein disulfide-isomerase; Protein disulfide-isomerase A3; Peroxiredoxin-1; Phosphoserine phosphatase; Triosephosphate isomerase; Elongation factor Tu, mitochondrial; Estrogen receptor alpha; Interleukin-3; Metallothionein-2; Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase; Histone deacetylase 1; Histone deacetylase 4; DNA-3-methyladenine glycosylase; Semenogelin-1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]; Histone deacetylase 8; Apoptosis regulatory protein Siva; Glycine receptor subunit alpha-1; E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2; Insulin; Utrophin; Aspartoacylase; Protein S100-A8; Protein S100-A9; Matrix metalloproteinase-9; Tumor protein p73; Protein S100-A2; Cellular tumor antigen p53; Metallothionein-3; Programmed cell death protein 6; DAN domain family member 5; Metallothionein-1A; Alpha-1B-glycoprotein; Alpha-2-macroglobulin; Angiotensinogen; Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein; Serum amyloid P-component; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoprotein A-II; Apolipoprotein A-IV; Apolipoprotein B receptor; Apolipoprotein E; Apolipoprotein L1; Complement C1q subcomponent subunit B; Complement C1q subcomponent subunit C; Complement C1r subcomponent; Complement C1s subcomponent; Complement C3; Complement C4-B; C4b-binding protein alpha chain; C4b-binding protein beta chain; Complement C5; Lys-63-specific deubiquitinase BRCC36; Complement component C8 alpha chain; Complement component C8 beta chain; Complement component C8 gamma chain; Complement factor B; Complement factor H; Complement factor I; Clusterin; Ceruloplasmin; Carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain; Carboxypeptidase N subunit 2; Dermcidin; Desmoplakin; Coagulation factor XII; Coagulation factor XIII B chain; Prothrombin; Ficolin-3; Fibrinogen alpha chain; Fibronectin; Gelsolin; Hemoglobin subunit alpha; Hemoglobin subunit beta; Haptoglobin-related protein; Hornerin; Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein complex acid labile subunit; Ig alpha-1 chain C region; Ig mu chain C region; Immunoglobulin kappa variable 1-17; Ig kappa chain V-III region GOL; Immunoglobulin lambda variable 3-21; Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1; Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2; Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3; Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4; Immunoglobulin J chain; Junction plakoglobin; Plasma kallikrein; Kininogen-1; Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1; Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 10; Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 14; Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 16; Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 2 epidermal; Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 5; Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 6A; Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 9; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2; N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase; Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1; Pregnancy zone protein; Protein S100-A7; Selenoprotein P; Alpha-1-antitrypsin; Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin; Kallistatin; Corticosteroid-binding globulin; Heparin cofactor 2; Sex hormone-binding globulin; Serotransferrin; Transthyretin; Vitronectin; Amyloid-like protein 1; Amyloid-like protein 2; Amyloid beta A4 protein; Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1; Carbonic anhydrase 1",cofactor; substrate

This blend of nine estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Enjuvia (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy associated with menopause. 

All estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).

Pharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms. Available as either ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A"" containing 9 estrogen derivatives (available as Cenestin) or as ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, B"" containing 10 estrogen derivatives (available as Enjuvia), these products are isolated as precursors from yam or soy plants and then chemically modified to mimic the products available in their naturally occurring form.","Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Estrogens; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers",Cytochrome P450 3A4; Estrogen receptor alpha; Thyroxine-binding globulin,substrate; ligand; inducer

Pharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms. Available as either ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A"" containing 9 estrogen derivatives (available as Cenestin) or as ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, B"" containing 10 estrogen derivatives (available as Enjuvia), these products are isolated as precursors from yam or soy plants and then chemically modified to mimic the products available in their naturally occurring form.","Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Estrogens; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers",Estrogen receptor alpha; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Thyroxine-binding globulin,ligand; substrate; inducer

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]

While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.

The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3† ,5†-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.","Adrenergic Agents; Adrenergic Agonists; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Adrenergics for Systemic Use; Adrenergics, Inhalants; Agents producing tachycardia; Agents that produce hypertension; Agents to Treat Airway Disease; Alcohols; Amines; Amino Alcohols; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Autonomic Agents; Bronchodilator Agents; Cardiotonic Agents; Cardiovascular Agents; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases; Neurotransmitter Agents; Peripheral Nervous System Agents; Protective Agents; Respiratory System; Respiratory System Agents; Selective Beta 2-adrenergic Agonists",Beta-2 adrenergic receptor; Beta-1 adrenergic receptor,agonist

Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s.

Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]","Adrenergic Agents; Adrenergic Antagonists; Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Agents causing hyperkalemia; Alcohols; Amines; Amino Alcohols; Antiarrhythmic agents; Antihypertensive Agents; Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension; Autonomic Agents; Beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers; Beta Blocking Agents and Thiazides; Beta Blocking Agents, Selective; Beta Blocking Agents, Selective, and Thiazides; Beta-Blockers (Beta1 Selective); Bradycardia-Causing Agents; BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates; Cardiovascular Agents; Cardiovascular System; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Hypotensive Agents; Peripheral Nervous System Agents; QTc shortening agents; Sympatholytics",Beta-1 adrenergic receptor; Beta-2 adrenergic receptor; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Bile salt export pump; Serum albumin,antagonist; substrate

After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]

It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Desipramine may be used to treat depression, neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), agitation and insomnia (unlabeled use) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (unlabeled use).","Adrenergic Agents; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; Agents producing tachycardia; Agents that produce hypertension; Agents that reduce seizure threshold; Anticholinergic Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Antidepressive Agents Indicated for Depression; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Central Nervous System Agents; Central Nervous System Depressants; Combined Inhibitors of Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (weak); Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Dibenzazepines; Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted; Enzyme Inhibitors; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Histamine Antagonists; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Membrane Transport Modulators; Muscarinic Antagonists; Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs; Nervous System; Neurotoxic agents; Neurotransmitter Agents; Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors; Non-Selective Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitors; OCT1 inhibitors; OCT2 Inhibitors; P-glycoprotein inhibitors; Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents; Psychoanaleptics; Psychotropic Drugs; QTc Prolonging Agents; Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome; Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists; Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonists; Serotonin Agents; Serotonin Modulators; Serotonin Receptor Antagonists; Tricyclics and Other Norepinephrine-reuptake Inhibitors",Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1; Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter; Beta-2 adrenergic receptor; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2; Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter; Histamine H1 receptor; Beta-1 adrenergic receptor; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5; Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Solute carrier family 22 member 2; Solute carrier family 22 member 1; Solute carrier family 22 member 3; Solute carrier family 22 member 5; P-glycoprotein 1; Solute carrier family 22 member 4; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2E1; Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C; Dopamine D2 receptor; Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors,antagonist; inhibitor; other; substrate; product of; binder
