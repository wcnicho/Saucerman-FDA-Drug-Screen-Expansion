It is composed of epidermal, dermal and hypodermal layers. The barrier function of the skin owed to its avascular epidermal layer, which is made mainly of keratinocytes. The keratinocytes form a stratified epithelium, with growing basal cells at the innermost layer and the keratinized, and mostly impermeable outer stratum corneum layer on the surface [L2452].

Foreskin keratinocytes are a form of skin cells that are cultured as a skin cell replacement for wounds, to accelerate wound closure and healing [L2434], [L2460]. 

The defining moment in skin culture was in 1975 when Rheinwald and Green successfully grew human keratinocytes on lethally irradiated murine fibroblasts. In 1981, O’Conner and his group utilized cultured autologous epithelium to coat burn defects for the first time. To construct a ""living"" alternative, a dermal substitute based on collagen I gel was created with mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts. When an epidermal layer was added, this approach became known as ""skin equivalent"", ""composite culture"" or ""organotypical culture"" [L2453].

Foreskin keratinocytes are an important ingredient in several skin substitutes [L2460], used for various indications. 
Keratinocytes are derived from neonatal foreskins and used to create a drug called _Apligraf_, a mixture of [DB10770] and keratinocytes. A gel made of bovine collagen is used as the matrix for cell growth and differentiation. Apligraf has been useful in the treatment of venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, by increasing rates of wound healing and decreasing the time required for closure of wounds [L2452].

Orcel, another skin substitute,  is similar to Apligraf since it contains both fibroblasts and keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskin, but in addition, utilizes a type I collagen sponge as its matrix. It is used for grafting onto partial-thickness wounds, where it offers a favorable matrix for host cell migration [L2452].",Allogeneic Cultured Cell Scaffold,Fibroblast growth factor 1; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor subunit alpha; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-6; Interferon gamma; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha; TGF-beta receptor type-2; Transforming growth factor beta-1; Tumor necrosis factor; Vascular endothelial growth factor A,agonist

Also known as Dermagraft, this device is a cryopreserved human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute. Composed of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and a bioabsorbable scaffold, it effectively supports wound healing [L2418].

Dermagraft has only been available in the United States as an investigational device (IDE). Dermagraft for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers was approved for sale in Canada in 1997. Dermagraft was introduced in the United Kingdom in October 1997, and several other European countries, as well as New Zealand and Australia. The device is available for commercial distribution in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, and The United Kingdom [L2418].

The impact of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) on individuals and society is devastating. Failure to observe proper wound care in this condition often results in amputation. If wound closure is achieved, it is likely to delay the need for surgical intervention and provide other benefits such as improvements in productivity, mental outlook, social interactions, and time at work, in addition to decreased mortality [L2438].

Interestingly, it has been shown that human foreskin cells possess immunosuppressive properties, which are mediated by other processes than that reported for bone marrow/stromal stem cells [A32655].  Dermagraft has been combined with [DB10772] to create a drug beneficial to patients with open burn wounds [L2427].",Allogeneic Cultured Cell Scaffold,Interleukin-6; Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1; Interleukin-1 receptor type 1; TGF-beta receptor type-2; Fibroblast growth factor 1; Interferon gamma; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor subunit alpha; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta; Transforming growth factor beta-1; Tumor necrosis factor,agonist

At the same time, the FDA also approved the therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) for utilization as a companion diagnostic with erdafitinib for selecting patients for the indicated therapy [L5956, L5959].

Erdafitinib's innovation lies in the fact that it is the first personalized treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer, which demonstrates the design of erdafitinib in developing more personalized and precision medicines with the capacity to target cancer treatment to a patient's specific genetic mutation [L5956, L5959]. Considering urothelial cancer is statistically the fourth most common kind of cancer in the world [F4372], the introduction of erdafitinib offers a welcome new option in the ever-expanding therapeutic tool kit to treat such prevalent medical conditions.

IL6R,Satralizumab,DB15762,,"Satralizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors, similar to [tocilizumab], which is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and based on an IgG2 framework.[L15536] Satralizumab is used in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) involving demyelinating lesions in the optic nerve, spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebrum.[A218551] Some of the pro-inflammatory mechanisms involved in NMOSD are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by IL-6, including increased production of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibodies and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, which allows for the passage of pro-inflammatory mediators into the CNS.[A218546,A218551] Satralizumab is thought to exert its therapeutic benefits by blocking IL-6 receptors and, subsequently, these inflammatory responses.

Enspryng®, a satralizumab formulation developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical and Roche,[L15536] is uniquely formulated with ""recycling antibody technology"" whereby the association of satralizumab to IL-6 receptors occurs in a pH-dependent manner[A218551] - this allows satralizumab to bind an IL-6 receptor until it reaches an endosome, after which the drug may dissociate from the receptor and move back into the plasma to act again. This novel mechanism effectively increases the duration of action of satralizumab, as it allows for single drug molecules to interact with multiple endogenous IL-6 receptors prior to elimination.

Satralizumab was first approved for use in Canada in June 2020 for the treatment of AQP4 antibody-positive patients with NMOSD.[A218551] It received subsequent approvals in Switzerland and Japan,[A218551] and was approved for use by the FDA in August 2020,[L15566] becoming the 3rd treatment to receive FDA approval for NMOSD (after [eculizumab] in June 2019 and [inebilizumab] in June 2020).","Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins; Antibodies; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Blood Proteins; Globulins; Immunoglobulins; Immunomodulatory Agents; Immunoproteins; Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonist; Proteins; Serum Globulins",Interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha,binder; antibody

In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate is a relatively stabilized form of vitamin E that is most commonly used as a food additive when needed [A32451].

Alpha-tocopherol acetate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.","Antioxidants; Benzopyrans; Biological Factors; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Diet, Food, and Nutrition; Food; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Micronutrients; Physiological Phenomena; Protective Agents; Pyrans; Tocopherols; Vitamin E; Vitamins; Vitamins (Fat Soluble)",SEC14-like protein 3; SEC14-like protein 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Protein kinase C beta type; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Protein kinase C alpha type; Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; Glutathione S-transferase A2; Glutathione S-transferase P; Glutathione S-transferase omega-1; Glutathione S-transferase Mu 3; Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Heme oxygenase 1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn],inducer; inhibitor

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]

In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, manufacturers typically convert the phenol component of the vitamin to esters using acetic or succinic acid, making a compound such as alpha-tocopherol succinate more stable and easier to use in vitamin supplements [A32956, A32957].

Alpha-tocopherol succinate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment, however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.

Moreover, although it is generally believed that alpha-tocopherol succinate would naturally demonstrate such general vitamin E-tocopherol pharmacodynamics after undergoing a logical de-esterification in the gut [A32956, A32957], there is ongoing research that proposes that the alpha-tocopherol succinate compound itself is capable of eliciting anti-cancer [L2699, A32959] and inflammation mediation [A32958] activities that are unique from the alpha-tocopherol form and other alpha-tocopherol esters [L2699, A32958, A32959].","Antioxidants; Benzopyrans; Biological Factors; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Diet, Food, and Nutrition; Food; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Micronutrients; Physiological Phenomena; Protective Agents; Pyrans; Tocopherols; Vitamin E; Vitamins; Vitamins (Fat Soluble)",SEC14-like protein 3; SEC14-like protein 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Protein kinase C beta type; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Protein kinase C alpha type; Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; Glutathione S-transferase A2; Glutathione S-transferase P; Glutathione S-transferase omega-1; Glutathione S-transferase Mu 3; Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Heme oxygenase 1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]; Lung epithelial cells; Diacylglycerol kinase,inducer; inhibitor

The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]","Agents Acting on the Renin-Angiotensin System; Agents causing angioedema; Agents causing hyperkalemia; Angiotensin 2 Receptor Blocker; Angiotensin II Antagonists and Calcium Channel Blockers; Angiotensin II Antagonists and Diuretics; Angiotensin II receptor antagonists; Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers; Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and diuretics; Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), plain; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension; Cardiovascular Agents; Cardiovascular System; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown); Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Heterocyclic Compounds; Hypotensive Agents; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates; OATP1B3 substrates",Type-1 angiotensin II receptor; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1,antagonist; substrate; inhibitor

Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy.

Azilsartan medoxomil is marketed under the brand name Edarbi. It is used to treat hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. It is also available in a combination product with [chlorthalidone]. As hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,[A7354] early management of hypertension has several implications on patients' survival rate and quality of life in the future. Lowering blood pressure is associated with a reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L32918] Azilsartan medoxomil is thus speculated to lower mortality rates and the onset of cardiovascular disease.

Enalaprilat was originally created to overcome the limitations of the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, which had numerous side effects and left a metallic taste in the mouth. Removal of the problematic thiol group from captopril resulted in enalaprilat, which was then modified further with an ester to create the orally available pro-drug enalapril.

Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.

Commonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing [hydrochlorothiazide] that is used for the management of hypertension.

Sirolimus was first approved by the FDA in 1999 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving renal transplants.[A242372] In November 2000, the drug was recognized by the European Agency as an alternative to calcineurin antagonists for maintenance therapy with corticosteroids.[A242412] In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.[L39292] In November 2021, albumin-bound sirolimus for intravenous injection was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa).[L39267] Sirolimus was also investigated in other cancers such as skin cancer, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and tuberous sclerosis.[A242372] The topical formulation of sirolimus, marketed as HYFTOR, was approved by the FDA in April 2022: this marks the first topical treatment approved in the US for facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.[L41494]","Agents causing angioedema; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antifungal Agents; Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates; Decreased Immunologic Activity; Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents; Immunologic Factors; Immunosuppressive Agents; Immunotherapy; Kinase Inhibitor; Lactones; Macrolides; mTOR Inhibitor Immunosuppressant; mTOR Inhibitors; Myelosuppressive Agents; Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; Ophthalmologicals; P-glycoprotein inducers; P-glycoprotein inhibitors; P-glycoprotein substrates; P-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index; Polyketides; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Selective Immunosuppressants; Sensory Organs; Sirolimus and Prodrugs",Cytochrome P450 3A4; Serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 3A7; P-glycoprotein 1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1; Serum albumin; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1; Apolipoproteins,substrate; inhibitor; inducer; binder

In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate is a relatively stabilized form of vitamin E that is most commonly used as a food additive when needed [A32451].

Alpha-tocopherol acetate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.","Antioxidants; Benzopyrans; Biological Factors; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Diet, Food, and Nutrition; Food; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Micronutrients; Physiological Phenomena; Protective Agents; Pyrans; Tocopherols; Vitamin E; Vitamins; Vitamins (Fat Soluble)",SEC14-like protein 3; SEC14-like protein 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Protein kinase C beta type; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Protein kinase C alpha type; Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; Glutathione S-transferase A2; Glutathione S-transferase P; Glutathione S-transferase omega-1; Glutathione S-transferase Mu 3; Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Heme oxygenase 1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn],inducer; inhibitor

Cholecystokinin, previously called _pancreozymin_, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine) and leads to the release of bile and digestive enzymes. CCK also acts as an appetite suppressant and has been studied for weight management regimens [L1637]. 

Normally, it is an endogenous hormone but is available commercially for diagnostic processes and replacement in pancreatic insufficiency [L1646, L1647, L1648]. in the octapeptide form.



Cholecystokinin is one of the first gastrointestinal hormones discovered, identified more than 90 years ago due to its ability to stimulate gallbladder contraction in 1928. Soon after, it was recognized to be identical to the factor responsible for stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion in 1943 [L1636]. This hormone has also been shown to have positive effects on enteric smooth muscle contraction and on nerve activity at multiple locations in the peripheral and central nervous system. In addition to its roles in promoting smooth muscle cell contraction/exocrine cell secretion, CCK promotes cell growth, energy production, gene expression and protein synthesis, processes that have profound for drug development [L1636].  This drug has also been investigated for possible antipsychotic properties, owing to its effect on CCK receptors in the brain [L1638].

Recent studies have suggested that cholecystokinin also plays a major role in inducing drug tolerance to opioids such as morphine and heroin, and is partially implicated in experiences of pain hypersensitivity during opioid withdrawal [A32101].","Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins; Cholagogues and Choleretics; Cholecystokinin, agonists; Cholecystokinin, antagonists & inhibitors; Diagnostic Agents; Gastrointestinal Agents; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Hormones; Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates; OATP1B3 substrates; Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors; Peptides; Tests for Pancreatic Function",Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; Cholecystokinin receptor type A; RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase; Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3; Pro-epidermal growth factor; Protein kinase C beta type; Gastrin/cholecystokinin type B receptor; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1,substrate; agonist; inhibitor

In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, manufacturers typically convert the phenol component of the vitamin to esters using acetic or succinic acid, making a compound such as alpha-tocopherol succinate more stable and easier to use in vitamin supplements [A32956, A32957].

Alpha-tocopherol succinate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120].

At the moment, however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.

Moreover, although it is generally believed that alpha-tocopherol succinate would naturally demonstrate such general vitamin E-tocopherol pharmacodynamics after undergoing a logical de-esterification in the gut [A32956, A32957], there is ongoing research that proposes that the alpha-tocopherol succinate compound itself is capable of eliciting anti-cancer [L2699, A32959] and inflammation mediation [A32958] activities that are unique from the alpha-tocopherol form and other alpha-tocopherol esters [L2699, A32958, A32959].","Antioxidants; Benzopyrans; Biological Factors; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting; Diet, Food, and Nutrition; Food; Heterocyclic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ring; Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring; Micronutrients; Physiological Phenomena; Protective Agents; Pyrans; Tocopherols; Vitamin E; Vitamins; Vitamins (Fat Soluble)",SEC14-like protein 3; SEC14-like protein 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Protein kinase C beta type; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Protein kinase C alpha type; Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; Glutathione S-transferase A2; Glutathione S-transferase P; Glutathione S-transferase omega-1; Glutathione S-transferase Mu 3; Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Heme oxygenase 1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]; Lung epithelial cells; Diacylglycerol kinase,inducer; inhibitor

Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage[A176104]. The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage[A176369].
